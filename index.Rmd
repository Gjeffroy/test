## Slide 1

Auroville (City of Dawn) is an experimental township in Viluppuram district mostly in the state of Tamil Nadu, India with some parts in the Union Territory of Puducherry in South India. It was founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (known as "the Mother") and designed by architect Roger Anger. As stated in Alfassa's first public message in 1965,

*"Auroville wants to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realize human unity."*
  —Mirra Alfassa[5]

## Slide 2

Where does the aurovilian come from?

```{r echo=FALSE, result = 'asis', message = F}
require('XLConnect')
require('dplyr')
require('ggplot2')
require('googleVis')

#load data
book <- loadWorkbook('AuroDemo.xlsx')
data_cl <- readWorksheet(book, sheet = "clean data")

book_nationality <- loadWorkbook('nationality.xlsx')
correspond <- readWorksheet(book_nationality, sheet = 1)


# Plotting / extracting information ---------------------------------------------------------------
#Nationalité des gens presents à auroville en avril 2016 (nombre, ratio)
count_nationality<- data_cl %>%
  filter(presence == "Present")%>%
  group_by(nationality)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))


count_country <-count_nationality%>%
  left_join(correspond, by = "nationality")%>%
  select(country, n)%>%
  filter(country != "india")


G <- gvisGeoChart(count_country, 
                  locationvar = "country", 
                  colorvar = "n", 
                  options=list(
                    displayMode="Markers",
                    colorAxis="{colors:['B0D8FF', '7DBCFA', '3B9CFE' ,'0080FF']}"))
plot(G)
